🛍️ Context Store
Context Store is a dynamic and modular e-commerce-style product management application built with React and React Context API.
It allows users to browse products, filter by categories, add or remove items from the cart,
and perform simulated purchase operations — all within a scalable and maintainable architecture.

This project demonstrates how to use the Context API for efficient global state management without external libraries like Redux,
making it ideal for medium to large-scale React applications.
